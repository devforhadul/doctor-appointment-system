    "question": "What is a custom hook in React and when should you use one?",

    "question": "Difference between controlled and uncontrolled components? Which one is better?",
    "answer": "In a controlled component, the component’s state is managed by React (using state hooks or props). In an uncontrolled component, the state is handled by the DOM itself, using references. Controlled components are preferred in React as they give you better control over the form data and UI, while uncontrolled components are easier to set up but less flexible.",

It is commonly used in forms with async validation or submission processes to enhance the UX by providing users with feedback during form submission.",
